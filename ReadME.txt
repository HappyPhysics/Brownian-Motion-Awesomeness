Project Description:

First Commit: 
	I set up the project with two sprites for molecules and the grain. I added a random force script to the grain.
	To get realistic motion I still need to tweek the parameters. Also the force is weird so far it doesn't
	seem like it's random because different run all seem to be moving upwards. I will close and restart.

Second Commit: 
	before: I will try to fix the force and make it truely random. Then I will start putting realistic parameters
	for average and standard deviation of the force.
