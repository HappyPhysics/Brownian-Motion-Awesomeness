Project Description:

First Commit: 
	I set up the project with two sprites for molecules and the grain. I added a random force script to the grain.
	To get realistic motion I still need to tweek the parameters. Also the force is weird so far it doesn't
	seem like it's random because different run all seem to be moving upwards. I will close and restart.

Second Commit: 
	before: I will try to fix the force and make it truely random. Then I will start putting realistic parameters
	for average and standard deviation of the force.
	
	After: The force on the grain is random (converted angle to degrees). I'm having problems instantiating many 
	molecules at the same time becuase thier position is not random even though I tried to change the seed for each.
	I didn't put the dependence on microscopic parameters yet (like temperature and molecule masses).
	Also I'm showing 4 motions at the same time on repeat for the statistics to be obvious.	

Third Commit: 
	before: I will upload to itch. Then I will fix molecules randomness and wall collisions.
